# Learning Glium
This repo will serve as a means of saving my work as I learn Glium, a wrapper for OpenGL for Rust.

I've used OpenGL previously with C++, but I wanted to try giving it a go in Rust. 
I'm still trying to work out the kinks of conjuring Satan through my computer, hopefully this will help me.

Don't mind the project, it isn't really of any use to you... Or maybe it is, do with it what you will, 
whatever it is that you can do with it anyway.
